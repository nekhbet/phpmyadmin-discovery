phpMyAdmin discovery

Sometimes (quite a lot, sadly) people install phpMyAdmin by just downloading it from https://www.phpmyadmin.net/downloads/ and unarchive it in root (for easy access probably).

This, combined with a google dork/logs/app in debug mode, that can show you a mysql username can prove fatal.

Scan your own domains and if you find such a folder .. just rename it to a more hard-to-guess name. Example ... pma123411234342

Enjoy!
